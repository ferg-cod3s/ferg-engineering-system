  "task": "Evaluate whether a startup should build their MVP as a monolith or microservices architecture. Consider team size, time to market, scalability requirements, development complexity, operational overhead, and future growth plans. Provide a specific recommendation with migration strategy.",
  "context": "A seed-stage startup with 5 engineers needs to launch their MVP in 4 months. They have limited DevOps experience and need to balance speed of development against future scalability. The product will handle user management, payments, notifications, and basic analytics. They expect rapid user growth if successful.",
